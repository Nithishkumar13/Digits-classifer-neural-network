# Digits-classifer-neural-network

The written digits database is the original MNIST handwritten digits database with no additional processing. It consists of 70000 images (60000 for training and 10000 for test) of 28 x 28 = 784 dimensions.
Our task is to classify the image with higher accuarcy model by usin Tensorflow.
